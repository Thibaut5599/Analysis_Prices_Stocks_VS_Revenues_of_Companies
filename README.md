# Analysis Prices of Stocks VS Revenues of associated companies

This project was followed as part of the Coursera training [IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?) during the fifth course entitled "Python Project for Data Science". It's a guided project whose main goal is to discover the yfinance API and practice Web Scraping.
This project was designed by Mr. Joseph Santarcangelo, Data Scientist at IBM.

## Project Overview
This project consists of extracting stock data (Tesla and GameStop) using the yfinance API and using webscraping (Requests & BeautifulSoup libraries) to extract the revenue data of these companie. Then representing this data on a graph to see how these companies' stock price and revenues have changed over time.

## Objectives
- Visualize how the price of Tesla and GameStop shares has changed over time in relation to the change in revenue of these companies.

## Project Contents
- Jupyter Notebook : Project_StockData.ipynb file shows the use of the yfinance API, the use of Web Scraping to extract data and the graphical visualization of this data.
- Screenshots : Screenshots_Plotly_Charts folder contains some PNG files corresponding to the plotly graphics screenshots inserted in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results and Conclusion
This project analyzed the stock prices of Tesla and GameStop alongside their revenue data.
- **Tesla :** The stock price increased in parallel with the company's rising revenues, indicating healthy business growth and a strong market valuation.
- **GameStop :** While the company's revenue remained stable between $1.3B and $3.6B, the stock price surged dramatically in early 2021. This spike was driven by a speculative bubble, largely fueled by retail investors (Reddit community) creating a "short squeeze."
This highlights the influence of external market factors on stock prices, as seen with GameStop, where the stock price did not align with the companyâ€™s financial fundamentals.

## Usage 
- Data Visualization : Open Project_StockData.ipynb to view the evolution of Share Price with Revenue over time.
