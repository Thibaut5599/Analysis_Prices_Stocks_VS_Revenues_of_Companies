# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data with Python

## Project Overview
This project consists of extracting stock data (Tesla and GameStop) using the yfinance API and using webscraping (Requests & BeautifulSoup libraries) to extract the revenue data of these companie. Then representing this data on a graph to see how these companies' stock price and revenues have changed over time.
This project was followed as part of the Coursera training "IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate" during the fifth course entitled "Python Project for Data Science". It's a guided project whose main goal is to discover the yfinance API and practice Web Scraping.
This project was designed by Mr. Joseph Santarcangelo, Data Scientist at IBM.


## Objectives
- Visualize how the price of Tesla and GameStop shares has changed over time in relation to the change in revenue of these companies.

## Project Contents
- Jupyter Notebook : Project_StockData.ipynb file shows the use of the yfinance API, the use of Web Scraping to extract data and the graphical visualization of this data.
- Screenshots : Screenshots_Plotly_Charts folder contains some PNG files corresponding to the plotly graphics screenshots inserted in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results and Conclusion
A compl√©ter !

## Usage 
- Data Visualization : Open Project_StockData.ipynb to view the evolution of Share Price with Revenue over time.
